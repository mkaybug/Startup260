# Specification
## Elevator Pitch
Do you have expenses? Savings goals? Need help budgeting but can't find a simple, easy to use, and free budgeting tool? We can help!

## Key Features
The first page the user sees is the login/create an account screen. If the user does not have an account, there is an option for them to create one. Clicking the "new account" button will lead them to another screen where they can input a new username (the program will check to make sure that username hasn't been used), password, and confirmation of that password.

After login/account creation, the user is taken to the home page which displays their pi chart. From here, users can edit their income, allocate budget to different purposes, add new expenses, and edit current expenses. All of which is displayed in the pi chart. The user can specify how often they want the pi chart to refresh based on their pay period.

There will also be a feature that allows the user to input a savings goal, specify the time in which they want to acheive that goal, and the program will allocate the appropriate budget in order to acheive that goal and track the user's progress towards that goal.

## Technologies
### Authentication
The default screen is the login screen. The program will associate a user's data with the username and password created by the user.

### Database Data
Certain data will need to be stored after the user exits the program. This includes income and budget allotments for various expenses.

### WebSocket data:
There is also data that will need to be generated by the program for the user to see. The savings goal calculator will use WebSocket data to calculate and return data on the progress the user has made towards their savings goals.

# HTML
I kept most things the same in my HTML implementation of my sketches. But, I did add another page for Expenses. I decided I wanted to be able to display all the expenses a user had entered, and that made more sense on a seperate page. I also haven't decided whether to include a progress bar for the savings tool. I may add that later. And I changed the layout of the MyPi page a little.

# CSS
I had to change my HTML **a lot**, turns out it wasn't functional, but I learned a lot. I completely changed my header, and decided it made more sense for my "MyPi" and "Expenses" tabs to be combined. Here are the Canva templates I made for myself before I started building the CSS. I may exclude the Pi chart completely, at the moment it isn't included in my CSS, if I can get it working, I'll include it later.
