        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>As a computer science major with a passion for family history,
           I've noticed a need in the genealogy world. Professional genealogists want a
           space where they can work on a project, somewhere seperate from FamilySearch where their work can't be
           undone by a well meaning FamilyTree co-editor. There is software available that does this
           in part, but it's outdated, and doesn't have all the functionality I'd like to include.
        </p>
        <p>
           I changed my project from a budgeting site to a research log because I've been thinking
           about this idea for a while and wanted to implement it anyway. Eventually I'd like to
           include other functionalities, but for now the research log will suffice.
