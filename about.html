        <p>This is a budgeting tool with a working title. You'll notice 
            I've combined the "MyPi" and "Expenses" tabs into the "Budget" tab.
            Now the budget can be edited and expenses added all on the same page. 
            Savings tool tracks the users progress to a financial goal and the goal
            can be updated anytime.
