## DNS and IP Addresses
When one device wants to talk to another it must have an IP address. For example, 128.187.16.184 is BYU's address. Usually, human users prefer a symbolic name over an IP address. The symbolic name is called a domain name. Domain names are converted to IP address by doing a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS).
