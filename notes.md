## DNS and IP Addresses
When one device wants to talk to another it must have an IP address. For example, 128.187.16.184 is BYU's address. Usually, human users prefer a symbolic name over an IP address. The symbolic name is called a domain name. Domain names are converted to IP address by doing a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS).
## Server
Key Pair file: Kaybugging.pem
### Remote Shell Into Server
```
-> ssh -i Kaybugging.pem ubuntu@18.210.220.50
```
The `Caddyfile` is the configuration file for your web service gateway. The `public_html` directory contains all of the static files that you are serving up directly through Caddy when using it as a web service. We will cover Caddy configuration in a later instruction. The `services` directory is the place where you are going to install all of your web services once you build them.
Need to exit?
```
-> exit
```
If warning that key pair file permissions are too open:
```
-> `chmod 600 Kaybugging.pem`
```
